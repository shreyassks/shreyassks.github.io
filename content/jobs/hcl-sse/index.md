- Collected Lung X-Ray images for 14 different chest abnormalities, applied spatial augmentation techniques to increase size of the training set. 
- Trained an Image classification based model using modified Densenet-121 architecture, achieved 96% classification accuracy due to spatial augmentation 
- Applied weight clustering and quantization techniques to make the model suitable for Edge deployment 
- Model size reduced by 50% to 75% with 5% and 15% compromise in accuracy due to quantization for FP16 and INT8 precisions respectively 
- Developed an Android application to benchmark inference time on ARMâ€™s Mali GPU (Samsung S9 Plus)
- Hardware acceleration improved by 30% and 80% when run on FP-32 and FP-16 TFLITE models on GPU respectively
