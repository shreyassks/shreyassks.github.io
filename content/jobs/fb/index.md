- Designed the pipeline with open source projects for Object detection (Detectron 2), Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Textual semantic similarity, Text-toSpeech (TTS), Template matching (OpenCV)

- Implemented image binarization technique based on research paper as a pre-processing step for OCR, optimized the performance using Scipyâ€™s Low Level Callables and Numba Jit compiler which reduced the computation time by 97% 

- Involved in data collection, data pre-processing, model selection and training, deployment to production of an Object detection model (Detectron 2) to detect AR Effects in WhatsApp and Messenger Video calling 

- Implemented K-means Clustering to segregate VA commands according to their respective domains. Collected VA responses from database, fine tuned and quantized ALBERT transformer for Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract entities from VA response for advanced processing 

- Analyzed various Transformer models fine-tuned for STS task (DistilBERT, BERT Large NLI, Laser). DistilBERT was selected and deployed based on similarity score and latency 

- Built and deployed a CLI client which was responsible in reducing execution time by 50%, reduced test case failure rate by 25% due to improved quality of speech, image transcriptions and advanced processing (Unsupervised Clustering, Token Classification)
